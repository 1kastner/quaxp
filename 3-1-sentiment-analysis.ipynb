    "Tweets and social networks in general have the great advantage of offering a lot of accessible data, usable for many tasks and researches. On Twitter for example, it is easy to collect tweets regarding a brand to analyze the perception of it by the public. This process is also called \"opinion mining\" and is widely used and researched.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example of sentiment analysis in Tweets, we want to build a model able to classify each Tweet into one of 3 categories: positive, neutral and negative. This kind of classification allows to get the overall expressed satisfaction on social media for a set of selected Tweets (for example, Tweets about a new product). The text is analyzed by the model according to the method we introduced in the previous page (TODO: add a link to the page where we explain the method). The kind of preprocessing that we use on the text might greatly impact the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides offering large amounts of data, social networks come with the difficulty that the language used is usually not normalized, with the use of slang, spelling mistakes, emojis and other noise in the data, making it hard to process by a text analysis model. That is the reason why we first need to apply some preprocessing techniques."

For example, if we want to do opinion mining about a product on Twitter, it is easier if we already have access to some labelled data, for example, a list of customer reviews with a score rating, from another website. By matching the score and the reviews, the model will be able to extract the words that are most often used for positive or negative ratings.\n",

Here, we took some food reviews together with a score, all written by customers, on the platform Amazon. From this data and the score, the model determined the most common words in _positive_ (4 or 5 scored) and in _negative_ (1 or 2 scored) reviews. Based on those lists of words, the model can now label new unseen reviews into _positive_ or _negative_, depending on which words are present in it. \n",
