    "- Introduction to image processing: how the image is represented in a computer and how it can be used for a machine learning experiment\n",
    "- Single image quality: how to assess the quality of a single image, based on features numerically computable, and how to modify an image to increase its quality for machine learning\n",
    "- Quality of a dataset of images: how to increase the quality of a bunch of images together to get better results in a machine learning experiment\n",
    "- General conclusion, quiz and practical task"
